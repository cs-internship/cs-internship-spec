# Companies
Companies play a vital role in the CS Internship ecosystem.

# Partnership Types

We have 2 levels of partnership with companies:
 1. **Hiring from CS Internship:** This is the initial phase of our collaboration with a company. At this stage, the company begins hiring graduates from the CS Internship Program. We provide guidance to help the company align with our standards in Processes, Technologies, and Mentorship Practices. This phase serves as a foundation for building the necessary infrastructure to support interns effectively.

 2. **Accepting Interns (Advanced Partnership):** This is the more advanced and trusted level of partnership. Once a company has successfully hired from the CS Internship Program and established a solid mentoring framework, it becomes eligible to accept practical interns. This indicates that the company has met our quality benchmarks and is equipped to provide a meaningful and structured internship experience.
