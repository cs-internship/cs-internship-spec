## Step 5. Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Part II, Chapters 4 to 12 (Introduction to Numpy).
  2. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Part III, Chapters 13 to 24 (Data Manipulation with Pandas).
  3. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Part IV, Chapters 25 to 36 (Visualization with Matplotlib).

### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Commentator**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/31/commentator) badge on StackOverflow.
 2. Achieve [**Nice Question**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/20/nice%20question) badge on StackOverflow.
 3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 244**.
 4. Do the exercise 3 in step 4 again but open the CSV file with **Pandas package** as a dataframe and add new four columns to it with name **MA1, MA2, MA3, and MA4** and for these columns calculate the [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of close price for durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 (N=5, 10, 15, and 30).
 5. Find at least 5 other online resources about numpy & pandas & matplotlib, and explain why you chose them.
 6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.
 7. Hold your step presentation on LinkedIn. Guidelines on how to present are provided on [this page](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/presentation-guidelines.md).
 8. It's time to **be a mentor**. Ask your mentor to start your onboarding process for mentorship.
