## Step 3. Generics

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.

### Tasks  <!-- omit in toc -->

  1. Achieve the **[Suffrage](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/804/suffrage)** badge on Stack Overflow.
  2. Achieve the **[Editor](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/3/editor)** badge on Stack Overflow.
  3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to lesson 202.
  4. Pass these at exercism.io:
        - Circular Buffer
        - Pangram
        - Pascal's Triangle
  5. Project: Create a simple library system to store and manage different types of library items (e.g., books, magazines, DVDs). (This project will help you understand and work with generics in C#)
      - Your project should have the following components:
          - `LibraryItem<T>`: A generic class representing an item in the library.
          - `Library`: A class containing a generic method to add items to a collection.
          - `LibraryManager`: The main class to manage library items and demonstrate the use of generic collections.
  6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.
  7. Hold your step presentation on LinkedIn. Guidelines on how to present are provided on [this page](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/presentation-guidelines.md).
