## Step 4. Intermediate JS (II)

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.

   - Each todo should have a complete button to toggle completion of the todo item.
   - Each todo should have an edit button to edit the title of the todo item.
   - Completed todo items should have a different style from other todo items.
   - Add 3 new buttons to filter todo items in the todo list:
     - **All**: shows all todos
     - **Active**: shows not-completed todos
     - **Completed**: shows completed todos
   - Current filter button should have a different style from the other filtering buttons.
