# The Nervous System

In CS Internship, we document everything, our decisions, our processes and everything else. Otherwise they will be forgotten or lost during the time.

This document describes a standard format for all of our documents. It is designed based on our requirements for creating an effective *"Nervous System"* for our community.

## The Anatomy
We have 3 main medias for publishing our contents through the nervous system:
 - GitHub
 - Telegram
 - OneNote

Each of these medias are designed to use for some specific kind of documents.
### GitHub
GitHub is the main media for CS Internship documents. We use it for its amazing collaboration mechanisms like versioning, history, branching, merging and...

The documents in CS Internship are not designed in a way to be self descriptive. The need an instructor to deliver its contents properly. 

Each GitHub document must have this structure:
 - **Main Content:** The main content of the document.
 - **Instructor Notes:** The notes which the instructor should check before starting to instruct the document to others. Notes about how do deliver the content properly, the prerequisite terminology or distinctions and ...
 - **Instructors:** A list of qualified instructors for this document. Anyone can refer to one of these instructors to get instructed about the document.
 - **FAQ:** Frequently Asked Questions about the document comes in this section.

This document itself is a sample of such document. You can use this as a sample document for structure and formattings.

#### How to Use a GitHub document?
If you want to study a document in GitHub you should:
 - **Find An Instructor:** Checking the *Instructors* section you should pick one and ask the instructor to tech the document to you.
 - **Check for Updates:** Document is a dynamic artifact. It would be updated by time. You can be notified about updates to the documents by a Telegram Channel: *"CS Internship - Mentors Feed"*. Make sure to get notified about the changes on documents.
 - **Request Updates:** If you feel something is wrong in a document or there is some update required for a document, you can simply submit an issue on GitHub for that document.Please enter the document link to the Issue comment that you want to update.

#### How to update or add a document?
If you need to update or add a document, it must be registered as an issue before sending a pull request.
This issue must have the link of the document you changed.

This is because after each issue is closed, a message goes to `CS Internship - Mentor Feed` channel in the Telegram (this possibility is provided by the [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) system) and there must be a link to the document in this message.

If a special hashtag is to be added, the person who wants to close the issue, it must add that hashtag to the label. For example, if he wants to enter the hashtag cs_internship, he must add *#cs_internship* in the label and then close it.


### Telegram 
We use *Telegram* for messaging and notifying system. For the mentors, we have these:
 - **CS Internship - Mentors**: A Telegram Group which mentors use to collaborate by messaging.
 - **CS Internship - Mentors Feed:** A Telegram Channel we use for notification. We notify about the document changes and all other announcemnts in this channel
    Any changes made to the GitHub decision section must be notified to everyone on the Telegram channel.
    As mentioned earlier, this operation is not manual and is performed automatically by the [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)  system

### OneNote
OneNote is just a draft, but a great one. We start everything on OneNote. Whenever it is structured enough, we move it to GitHub as a document.

# Instructor Notes
Before starting to talk about the Nervous System, the instructor should completely describe the problem we had before. We were a brain, thinking, and finding great solutions, but there was no effective way to make the solution work! Just like a brain in a corpse! We knew what to do, but couldn't make it work. To make it work we need something like the nervous system in our body. The nervous system knows how to deliver each valuable data to the organisms related to it. In fact, this nervous system turns a corpse to a living body. In CS Internship we designed the nervous system to turn our corpse to a living body too! And we are still working to improve it.
