# Queue Executive Responsibilities

This document aims to describe what the person in charge of queue (which we call **queue executive**)  is supposed to do during the sprint.

## Glossary and General Info

### Glossary

  - **Pre-queue**: is a queue in which applicants who have not yet talked to five people are in.  
  - **Queue**: This is the queue, whose functionality is to show us the order in which applicants enter a course. Order of applicants in queue is based on the time they announced they are done talking with five people, **not** the time they entered the queue telegram group.
  - **Applicant**: a person who wants to enter a course, whether they are in queue or pre-queue or even none of them yet, is called an applicant.

### General Info

- The applicants should be ordered based on the time they announce they have talked with five CSers and then the time they entered the queue Telegram group.

- The states, an applicant can have and documents should present include:
  - in pre-queue
  - in queue
  - interviewed
  -	dropped
  - in course

- This document won't cover anything about how the OneNote pages should be structured. It will only describe the functionalities that OneNote pages are supposed to have. As an example, the choice of merging pre-queue and queue in the same table or not, is not relevant to this doc.

## Responsibilities

### Being ready to be asked by a mentors to do a task

The queue executive should be ready to be asked by another mentors to do a task, such as adding an applicant to the queue Telegram group or removing someone after they are interviewed.

### Check if we are ready to conduct an interview

Queue executive must know exactly how many interns each mentor is willing to have, and how many interns the mentor already has.

Whenever queue executive finds out that there is a mentor who has less interns than they are willing to have, and there exists some applicants who want to enter one of our courses, should announce that we are ready to conduct an interview and should also assign a mentor to organize the session.


### Add an applicant to pre-queue

A random person may happen to get interested in cs internship and want to enter one of the courses and will be added to pre-queue.

**1- Add to telegram group**  
Queue executive is responsible for adding that person to the telegram group (CS Internship - Queue). And greet the applicant by also introducing cs-internship to them.

**2- Ask to talk with at least five CSers**  
Here is the list of things that a queue executive must ask the applicant to do:
- Ask them to talk with five CSers.
- Inform them about what they are supposed to ask and what kind of information they need to gather.
- Inform the applicant by sending a message to the Telegram group and mentioning them, that whenever they are done with talking, they need to announce it in that group.
- Inform them that the order in the queue is based on the time they announce that they've talked with five CSers, not the time they entered the group.

**3- Update OneNote**  
Queue executive is responsible for writing the information of the applicant and their state in OneNote (e.g., are they in queue or in pre-queue? have they been interviewed? and so on). **Please do not forget to fill in all the fields in the table**.

### Add an applicant to queue
Whenever an applicant announces in the telegram group that they have talked with five CSers and are willing to enter a course, queue executive should:
1- Update the corresponding queue OneNote page, so that it shows the applicant is in queue, not in pre-queue Keep in mind when the applicant enters the queue, remove him/ her from the pre-queue.

2- Send an update to the Telegram group indicating their position in queue and what course they are going to enter. This update also shows the order of the other applicants in the same queue.

### Remove from Telegram group
After each interview meeting, one of the tasks to get done is to update the Telegram group and OneNote pages. Hence the interview organizer will ask queue executive to update the required information. The details of accomplishing this task are as follows:

1- Updating state of the applicant in OneNote pages. So that the document shows the applicant has been interviewed in queue page on the OneNot and possibly will enter one of the courses shortly. if they enter one of the courses queue executive should be add to the course table in OneNote

2- Posting an announcement in the Telegram group that the applicant has been interviewed, hence they are going to be removed from the group.

3- Removing the applicant from Telegram group.

4- Sending a post indicating the recent update of the order of applicants in queue to the Telegram group.

5- Queue executive should tell the applicant at top of the queue that they are the next one to be interviewed. In case of any requests by the applicants to stop for some period of time, the queue executive should set their status as paused in queue and tell them: “it is not a problem, but We do not follow up on whether you want to enter the course or not. Whenever you are ready, please announce in this group that you are out of stop mode.” Now if they refuse to enter the course or to be in queue, queue executive should be moved to the dropped table in OneNote and also removed from the Telegram group.

# FAQ

- **Which mentor should I ask to organize an interview?**  
At the time of writing this document, we have not a predefined strict rule for this purpose. You need to talk in groups with other mentors to decide who organizes the meeting. However, it is recommended to choose from the mentors who are participating in the meeting.
- **What does "organizing an interview" mean?**  
Although interview meeting is one of the most critical processes (as it is the first direct contact between cs internship and the interns), there is no documentation for that process yet. You are supposed to talk in groups with other mentors to know more about organizing an interview. Don't do anything based on assumptions. Make sure anything you do is approved by others.
- **What should we do if the applicant is not accepted after the interview?**
he or she Will be removed from this course, so the queue executive must delete the person's information from in queue page on the OneNote and move to dropped page on the OneNote
 - **What if applicant says they are not ready to enter the course**
 If queue executive talks with the applicant in order to prepare them for interview meeting and inform them that they can now enter the course and the applicant says that they can't enter the course now, then:  
 queue executive must remove the applicant from queue. If the applicant still wants to enter the course in some other time, they can ask the queue executive to add them to end of the queue after they are removed.
