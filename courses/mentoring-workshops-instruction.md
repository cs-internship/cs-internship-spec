## How to participate in the mentors training workshops?
### Default Instruction: 
1. After you have watched each video, then you should write your report about it, and send it to your coordinator.
2. You should set up a meeting for yourself. You will attend each mentorship workshop only for one report. 
    - **Note**: In mentorship workshop meetings, you need to turn on your camera, and the meetings will be held visually. 
	- **Note**: If you think that you are ready to watch the next video and attend in a single mentoring workshop for two reports, then you can use the alternative instruction explained in the next part.
4. Since you have already gained access to the desired workshop group, you must be present at the specified time and day for the session as scheduled.
5. You can watch the next video at least 7 days after the first one, and repeat the default instruction for it.

### Alternative Instruction:
- If you want to pass the mentorship workshops faster, it is possible to participate with two reports in a single workshop. For this purpose, please follow the instructions below:
  
1. Watch the first mentorship workshop video in your step.
2. Send the report of the first video to your coordinator and set up a meeting for yourself.
3. If you are ready to start the next video, then ask your coordinator to forward your first report to a mentor to check for its quality.
	- **Attention Please!**
       	- There is no guaranty that mentors will have time to check the report in the current sprint.
       	- So, it is almost 50-50 to get a chance to participate in a workshop for two reports.
5. The mentor will set a deadline to say their assessment result about your report to your coordinator.
	- **Positive** assessment result, means then you can start to watch the next video, wirte its report and send it to your mentoring inter before the setteled mentorship workshop. 
	- **Negative** assessment result, means that you have to attend in separate workshops for each mentorship videos. It helps the concepts proposed in the videos to be more clarify for you. 

#### **Important Note:** 
- Please keep in mind that mentor availability to review your reports is not guaranteed. Furthermore, the deadline for reviewing your reports may be set in a way that it doesn't affect the scheduling of mentorship sessions to be held sooner.
- For the first video of the communication ,you cannot use the Alternative mode, and you must set up a meeting for it
