## Step 9. Intermediate TS (I)

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.

### Tasks <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Join Exercism’s **TypeScript** Track and pass these exercises:

   - ETL
   - Grade School

   Learn how to run tests for these steps, and run all available tests in the spec file (remove the "x" from the beginning of each "xit").

   - Use GitHub as your source control.
   - Publish it on your JSFiddle account.
  
2. Create a project that can showcase products by fetching data from [this API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products). You **can** use [this base design](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/web/images/step9) that we have provided. The sorting and category buttons do not need to be functional at this step.
   
   - Use GitHub as your source control and showcase your project on GitHub Pages.

3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com with 5 stars up to **lesson 388**.

4. Achieve the [**Vox Populi**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/1108/vox-populi) badge on Stack Overflow.

5. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.

6. You should give a 20-minute presentation about the content of this step on the LinkedIn Live platform. Record your Live presentation at the time of the presentation and then send it to your coordinator with a brief explanation of the topic. All LinkedIn Live presentations will be published on the [CS Internship YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@csinternship8859).
