# Onboarding New Mentors
We are open and enthuciastic to work with new mentors. We believe they can bring a lot of value to our program. But hey! Mentoring is not an easy job at all. Mentors are going to be the evangelist of our culture. They are going to incept what they are to the interns, so they should be a true CSer to accompolish this critical job. Now when it comes to
onboarding mentors, you should know that it's a very important task to be accomplished as well, what does it mean? You may ask: isn't it just showing the place around and telling them what to do or not to do?

Well, certainly not. If this is how you think about it just stop there. Starting to be a mentor in CS internship is a new beginning for the new mentors themselves. They learn,
experience and of course grow all the way through this mentorship phase. Yes this is a win-win game; they take this opportunity to learn and help others (either mentors or interns) to learn from them. It should be clarified why they want to become a mentor; do they understand the value of it, if not explain to them. We don't want people just to be mentors without fully understanding its purposes and the reasons behind it. We need them to think of it as a value to reach, not just sth to evade.

## Mentor Specifications

We love to work with mentors having these specifications. Most of these items are based on [CS Culture](http://isazadeh.net/ayaz/announcements/CsCulture.pdf) by [Ayaz](http://isazadeh.net/ayaz/index.htm)

#### Integrity
We must have integrity, must live the integrity through our life. The integrity must be a core value in our beliefs. We konw the integrity is not a state, it is a path. We are a bunch of people living our integrity journey in our life.

#### Advising
Mentor means an experienced and trusted adviser. Not a mother or father. A mentor should always be there for the intern and advise him/her but mentoring is not about interrupting the intern every minute.

#### Courage

We have courage, the courage to ask, the courage to answer, the courage to be criticized and ...

#### Work
We love our work, the process of helping the others. If it is not a joyful work for us, there should be nothing making us to do so. So basically mentors should be volunteers to do the mentoring and volunteerly share their time to help the others.

#### Dynamism

We are dynamic in all aspects of our work. We continuously look at our work and process to improve it.

## The Flow

#### 1. Successful Integrity Situation

New mentors should pass some basic requirements to enter the program as a mentor.
For each new member, there should be a previous successful *integrity situation* happened between the mentor and one of us. So we can make sure the level of integrity of the mentor.

#### 2. Commitment Statement

If so, the mentor should send a **Commitment Statement** to the mentors group, stating why is she/he joining the mentors and what is his commitment in the group. The commitment should contain the time that she/he is going to dedicate for this job weekly.

#### 3. Learning how to be a Mentor

The **first task** for mentors is to learn what is being a mentor, and it is her/his job to learn, by asking the other mentors, studying the documents. The mentor should promise a time in which she/he is ready to start mentorship.

#### 4. Getting to know the other mentors

After being qualified for mentorship, the new mentor should introduce him/herself to other mentors through one-to-one conversation and get to know them.

Each conversation should meet these goals:

-They should be able to introduce you to the other club members.

-Get to know them by asking questions about their technical and non-technical background.

-What kind of technical questions they can answer?

After knowing each mentor, the new mentor should send a post about them on LinkedIn expressing his/her feeling.

#### 5. Participating in the weekly sprint session

The mentor has to participate actively in the weekly structural and operational meetings. By the means of Integrity the mentor should announce other mentors and send them a text including his tasks.
If The mentor could not attend any of those two weekly meetings, he/she should:  
- watch the video of the meetings carefully, before the next weekly meetings are held.
- write the report of then meetings they have been absent in, and share it in *CS Internship - Mentors* telegram group before the next weekly meetings are held . Sent message(s) should have a specific hashtag whose format is #گزارش_اسپرینت_<sprint_number>, for exmaple:  #گزارش_اسپرینت_104.

#### 6. Check intern tasks
The mentor should check intern's tasks regularly and update his page on one note

#### 7. Upload intern twitches in YouTube
As you know, one of the tasks each intern does in each step, is giving a live presentation on Twitch Platform. 
- The mentor should get the video of their intern's twitch, and upload it in the CS Internship YouTube channel.
- The mentor, should write the link to the video in intern's profile in OneNote. So that anyone could find out that the twitch task is done and the link to video of the twitch is accessible.

#### 7. Read the new intern process document

## So here is what you should do when you take this role

1. Start with a tinge of ice breaking and try to have a warm talk. Explain the values and goals of being a mentor in CS internship and what benefits it provides. If you think you
can't do this, ask a more experienced mentor to help you.

2. There is a page in OneNote under this path: [(Mentorship/Onboarding Mentors)](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=A9B215A332F3E600%21392628&page=Edit&wd=target%28Mentorship.one%7C9c6c7595-3f1a-407b-af72-6ee7b988712c%2FTemplate%20Onboarding%20Mentors%7C67ac7473-0e47-43cd-9d23-0805fde9c774%2F%29). Go there, use the template to make a new subpage for the new mentor. Do the items listed there
and check each one when you're done. The title of this subpage should be the name of the new mentor. Don't forget to mention your own name here as a person who performs this 
onboarding.

# Instructor Notes
There was another document before this one, for mentors' specifications but it never mentioned the required tasks for onboarding new mentors. We had this problem that, the responsibilities for this role were unclear and the person in charge could possibly forget what they were up to. So here you can find any information about mentors' specifications and also each and evey task to be done by this role of onboarding new mentors.
