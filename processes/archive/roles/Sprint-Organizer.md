# The tasks of responsible for holding Sprint

At CS_Internship, we have a 1.5-hour session each week that discusses the status of interns, questions, issues, and improving course process and making it more efficient. In order to hold the meeting, we need one of the mentors to take charge of the meeting every week. Generally, the management and control of the meeting regarding raising issues and advancing the issue and managing time is the responsibility of Sprint.

## How to use the tools that the person in charge of the meeting needs:

###  OneNote

Use Task **Management => Mentor’s Info** to read the names of the mentors and check the information to be corrected in case of any issues and Task **Management => Task Management** to assign the tasks to mentors. 

Use **Meetings => Open Topics** to express open topics and write other mentors comments, which the responsible of the meeting before session arranges the pages according to the intended prioritization (this prioritization is done by the person in charge of the meeting, and the mentor may request that his or her subject be prioritized, in which case his or her subject will be prioritized).

Use **Meetings => Sprint Meetings** to write a summary of topics and decisions taken.

Move topics from Open Topics to **Meetings => Topic Archive** for topics that have been discussed and finalized.

### Azure

Use **Board =>Azure** to check the status of the tasks given to the mentors and assign new tasks.

Weekly tasks are created with a backlog called **Sprint Tasks** and are assigned for the next sprint.

The title of the other backlog tasks is determined according to the subject of the task and their date is assigned in related Sprint according to the mentor's declared date.

## Work process of Sprint responsible

### Before the meeting

Each designed task during the week is assigned to one of the mentors. In a way that mentors can willingly undertake the task and in case no one volunteers to perform the task, Sprint manager will choose a mentor him/herself, considering the history of this responsibility in the past and the workload of the mentors.
Tasks that for some reason have not been completed by due date and the mentor requests to transfer the task to another sprint will be transferred to the desired sprint in Azure.
People who are unable to attend the meeting give a message to the mentor group about the status of the interns and their tasks, and the responsible of the meeting should review their message and know who would be absent.

### Hold a meeting 

The responsible of the meeting on Monday at 9 o'clock will call the CS_Internship sprints group on Skype.
After making a call, he / she should check and inform the absents of the meeting.
If a mentor has not already announced his / her absence from the meeting, then he / she will be contacted again to determine his / her status in the meeting.

#### The first part of the meeting

The first part deals with reviewing the process of tasks and the status of interns and assigning new tasks.

1.	Recording the session
2.	Use Mentor’s Info on OneNote; By saying the name of each mentor, they talk about the interns, their tasks, and the topics they want to talk about in the meeting. And the use of azure, which if the mentor has a task, he must download it before his own meeting and talk about the task if necessary. (By reading the absentees, the explanations they gave about their work are also read).
3.	Simultaneously assign tasks to people in OneNote and Azure; each mentor voluntarily declares his / her readiness to perform the task. If someone does not take responsibility for the task, he / she will be relieved according to which mentor has not done that task for a long time and does not have another task.
4.	Stop video recording

#### The second part of the meeting

The second part deals with examining the raised issues and questions and deciding to change the process of the issues.

1.	Re-recording session
2.	Use the Open Topics section on OneNote to talk about open topics; in this part, the person in charge of the meeting, according to the prioritization that was done before the meeting, starts to raise issues and the mentors express their opinions in these cases. And the responsible of the sprint notes the mentors on the relevant page while they are announcing their opinions. And finally, he writes down the decision made on the issue. After discussing and deciding on a topic, it identifies and assigns new tasks related to the topic. Here, too, the acceptance of the task is optional, and if no one was ready the responsible of the sprint will assign the task to the mentor who has no task. And then the next issue is raised and the process continues in the same way. During the meeting, the management of the meeting is with the responsible of the sprint, and it is up to him to control that there is no irrelevant discussion.
3.	Stop video recording

### After the meeting

The responsible of the sprint writes a summary of the meeting about what was discussed and what decisions were made in the sprint topic section of OneNote. And uploads the link to this section in the Mentor Feed channel with the hashtags #remaining_topics, #summary and #sprintNumber.

If we reach a conclusion on a topic and the topic is closed, the person in charge of the meeting will transfer the issue to the Topic Archive. (This can be done during the meeting).

# Instructor Notes
The tasks of the sprint manager include various things to do before, after, and during the sprint. As there was no document on the subject, somethings might be forgotten or not done right so the new mentors, the person in charge of the meeting, that were added were unaware of the tasks they had to do. This document helps the mentors who are responsible for holding Sprint to know what tasks to do and how to do them.
