## Step 4. Intermediate JS (II)

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a mentor based on your report.

### Tasks <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Refactor style and themeable of the calculator (from the previous step) with SCSS/SASS.

2. Enhance the Todo App following these instructions:

   - Each todo should have a remove button to omit the todo item from the todo list.
   - Each todo should have a complete button to toggle completion of the todo item.
   - Each todo should have an edit button to edit the title of the todo item.
   - Completed todo items should have a different style from other todo items.
   - Add 3 new buttons to filter todo items in the todo list:
     - **All**: shows all todos
     - **Active**: shows not-completed todos
     - **Completed**: shows completed todos
   - Current filter button should have a different style from the other filtering buttons.
   - Use GitHub as your source control and showcase it on GitHub Pages.

3. Pass this exercise at exercism.org:

   - Pascal's Triangle

   Learn how to run tests for these steps, and run all available tests in the spec file (remove the "x" from the beginning of each "xtest").

   - Use GitHub as your source control.
   - Publish it on your jsFiddle account.

4. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com with 5 stars up to **lesson 244**.

5. Achieve the [**Student**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/2/student) badge on StackOverflow.

6. Name 5 useful Web libraries and describe what they do and why they're good. Give a star to their GitHub repo.

7. Find at least 5 more online resources about JS and explain why you chose them.

8. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a Twitch session for you on your deadline day.

9. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Linkedin live platform. You should record your Linkedin live at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All Linkedin live presentations will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.
