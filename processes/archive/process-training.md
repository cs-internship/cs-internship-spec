## What is a Step?

Each course consists of some steps (about 10 steps). Interns should accomplish all steps to graduates the course.
The steps are ordered, so to unlock a step, the intern should accomplish its previous step.

Each step is a set of some **Study Items** and some **Tasks**.

## Study Items and Tasks

**Study Items** are some resources that should be studied. It could be a chapter of a book, an article, a blog post or a video.

If it is an online resource available on the web, its link is provided in the step. If it is a chapter of an eBook or a video which is not available online, the intern should find it herself. Finding the resource is a part of the process itself and improves the search skills for the intern.

**Tasks** are some pieces of work that intern should do. Examples of tasks are *'Writing a piece of code to do something'*, *'Achieving a specific badge on StackOverflow'*, *'Doing a research about a specific concept'* and ...

## How To Start a Step

To start a step, the mentor gives the step content to the intern. The intern has 2 days to assess the step and give an estimate which he/she is committed to finish this step. This is very important as it is the main practice for integrity. Mentors are progressively checking the interns for their commitment integrity.


## How To Accomplish a Step

To deliver a study item or task, interns should:
- **LinkedIn:** Post at least one `#cs_internship #[courseName] #[stepNumber]` update describing:

## How To Finish a Step

To finalize a step, The intern should give a 15 minutes ***Twitch Presentation*** and talk about his/her achievements of this step. Intern should record the twitch, add a brief description about the topic and send it to his/her mentor. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.
The student have a 15-20 min time, free to talk about anything! She/he should share and stream her/his screen, it could be a block of code, a part of an article or a book, or a PowerPoint presentation, or anything! Via this twitch session, the student should demonstrate what she/he achieved within this step and share it with others.
The attendees of this sessions are mentors and the other students. They could ask any question within the session via comments.

Here is some notes about the twitch:
- The Twitch presentation should give an insight of what the intern have learned during the step.
- Other interns of the course and mentors of the course ***must*** audit the presentation so the intern should pick a time which all this people (or most of them) are available.
- Initially the Twitch is organized by the mentor and the scrum master for the day which the intern will finish the step. If the intern cannot make it to the date and step is not yet finished without postponing the deadline the intern himself should re organize the twitch with the people.
- In case of emergency if an intern cannot set a time for the twitch he/she can record the twitch, add a brief description about the topic and send it to his/her mentor in order to publish the twitch on CS Internship YouTube channel.
