## Weekly Activity & Reporting Guideline

### Activity Guidelines

- For every study item or task, you are required to publish **at least one post** on each of the following platforms: **LinkedIn**, **Twitter (X)**, and **Telegram** â€” meaning at least three posts per item.
- Your posts should reflect your **actual activity**. You are expected to remain active and post on a **weekly basis**.
- Posting is the primary way your progress is tracked. You are not required to complete the item before posting. You should share your learning process or ongoing progress.
- Include the following hashtags in all your posts:  
  `#cs_internship`  
  `#[courseName]`  
  `#[stepNumber]`
- Every LinkedIn post must also include the following link:
