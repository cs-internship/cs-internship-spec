# Machine Learning

## Outlook
This course is designed for students who want to learn **Machine Learning**. In this course, you will learn how to use Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries and the most popular Python packages like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Besides, learning the Math in **Machine Learning**, It is one of the main parts of this course and learning **Machine Learning** algorithms. By doing so, you will be able to work and solve problem in the World.
