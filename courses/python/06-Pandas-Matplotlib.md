  2. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 4 (Visualization with Matplotlib)


### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Nice Answer**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/23/nice-answer) badge on StackOverflow.
 2. Achieve [**Self-Learner**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/14/self-learner) badge on StackOverflow.
 3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 316**.
 4. Do the excercise 3 in step 4 again but open the CSV file with **Pandas** **package** as a dataframe and add new four columns to it with name **MA1, MA2, MA3, and MA4** and for these columns calculate the [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of close price for durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 (N=5, 10, 15, and 30).
 5. Plot the generated moving average columns from previous excercise for first 100 data points in a single window.
 6. Find at least 5 other online resources about pandas & matplotlib, and explain why you chose them.
 7. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform.
