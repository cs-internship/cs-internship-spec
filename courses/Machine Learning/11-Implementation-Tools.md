## Step 11.  Implementation Tools


### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with a mentor based on your report.
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 13 (Parallelizing Neural Network Training with TensorFlow).
  2. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 14 (Going Deeper – The Mechanics of TensorFlow).


### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Enlightened**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/19/enlightened) badge on StackOverflow.
 2. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 418**.
 3. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 4. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform. You should record your twitch at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.

In the mentoring training path, you should watch the **"fifteenth"** and **"sixteenth"** videos of the 16 videos for the **"Coaching"** course. Here're the links:

  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life.
