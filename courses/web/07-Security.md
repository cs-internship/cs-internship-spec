## Step 7. Security

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.

- To apply authentication in Task 1, you can use the server we have prepared for you [here](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/web/servers/step7/server-step-7.rar).

### Tasks <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Enhance the Todo App to have an authentication system:

   - Add a 'Sign up' page to the Todo App.
   - Add a 'Sign in' page to the Todo App.
   - Use a method to apply authentication on all HTTP requests.
   - Use GitHub as your source control and showcase your project on GitHub Pages.

2. Enhance the Todo App to store the state of the app for each user separately. Enable the Todo App to work for anonymous users too.

   - Use GitHub as your source control and showcase your project on GitHub Pages.

3. Add a header to the Todo App with the following functionalities:

   - A label to show the current user's display name.
   - A 'Sign up' button to navigate to the 'Sign up' page.
   - A 'Sign in' button to navigate to the 'Sign in' page.
   - A 'Sign out' button to log off the current user.
   - Apply visibility of each button based on the current state of the app.
   - Use GitHub as your source control and showcase your project on GitHub Pages.

4. Pass these exercises at exercism.org:

   - ETL
   - Grade School

   Learn how to run tests for these steps, and run all available tests in the spec file (remove the "x" from the beginning of each "xtest").

   - Use GitHub as your source control.
   - Publish it on your JSFiddle account.

5. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com with 5 stars up to **lesson 357**.

6. Achieve the [**Teacher**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/1/teacher) badge on Stack Overflow.

7. Find at least 5 other online resources about Authentication on the Web and explain why you chose them, then share them on Twitter and LinkedIn.

8. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.

9. You should give a 20-minute presentation about the content of this step on the LinkedIn Live platform. Record your Live presentation at the time of the presentation and then send it to your coordinator with a brief explanation of the topic. All LinkedIn Live presentations will be published on the [CS Internship YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@csinternship8859).
