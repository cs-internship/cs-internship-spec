# Meetings

There are different kinds of meetings which mentors should master.

- [**Entrance Interview**](/meetings/meeting-entrance-interview.md): This is the frist and the most important interview with a new intern. If the intern says yes he/she should really mean it based on a really important decsion in her/his life!
- [**Entrance Debrief Interview**](/meetings/meeting-entrance-interview-debrief.md): In this meeting we ask the under-training-mentor to debrief the meeting. 
- [**Problem check**](/meetings/meeting-problem-check.md): This meeting is to understand the root cause of a problematic situation (mostly Commitment-Break) and let the intern to face with its inner root cause.
