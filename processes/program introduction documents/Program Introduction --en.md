# **What Is the CS Internship Program**

The **CS Internship** is a completely **free** and **fully remote** program designed to prepare interns for entering the job market and working with **professional remote teams**. The program focuses on teaching the essential skills required to work with highly skilled teams and to **create value in large companies**.

Since **soft skills** play a crucial role in the success or failure of a software team, the core focus of this program is on teaching soft skills. These include skills such as **making commitments**, **asking questions**, **giving answers**, **sharing information**, **helping others**, **problem solving**, and many other abilities. All these skills are developed throughout the internship using carefully designed tasks.

The program currently includes three tracks: **Web**, **C#**, and **Machine Learning**. In addition to technical knowledge, interns gain valuable soft skills in a realistic and professional environment.

All interns share their progress and reflections on LinkedIn and Twitter using the hashtag [**#cs_internship**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/csAbRinternship/). You can browse these posts to get familiar with the culture of the program.

The most important value emphasized in this program is **Integrity**, a foundational principle for both individual and team success.

## **Learning Approach**

Nothing is explicitly taught to you in this program. Instead, mentors in different roles guide interns throughout their learning journey. One of the most important features of this program is that mentors **voluntarily choose to help new interns**.

You are responsible for your own learning, and we walk alongside you during the entire journey.

Each track is divided into **clear and structured steps**. For example, the **C Sharp track** consists of **11 steps**, which together shape the technical learning path.

After completing all steps, the intern enters a **six month practical phase**. During this period, the intern works remotely with a **professional team** on a **real, live project**, gaining real world experience in highly disciplined environments and **advanced software architecture**.

## **What Does a Step Include**

Each step contains **learning resources** and **tasks**.

### **Learning resources may include:**
- A chapter from a book  
- An article  
- A blog post  
- An educational video  

### **Tasks may include:**
- Writing a piece of code  
- Earning a specific badge on Stack Overflow  
- Practicing touch typing  
- Other skill-building exercises  

All resources are in **English**, so you should already feel comfortable reading technical English or be determined to improve this skill as you progress.

At the end of each step, interns deliver a **20 minute online presentation** on **LinkedIn**, showcasing their achievements and learnings.

## **How a Step Is Completed**

A mentor provides the content of each step to the intern. The intern then has **24 hours** to review the content and **make a commitment** to the mentor. This means promising **when the step will be completed**.

From that point on, the intern is fully responsible for completing all tasks, while still being able to ask for help from the mentors.

The program takes these commitments **very seriously**. If the intern realizes they cannot meet their original promise, they must **immediately inform** their mentor and make a **new commitment**.

Interns must consistently share their achievements and learnings on **Twitter** and **LinkedIn** using the hashtag [**#cs_internship**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/csAbRinternship/). Mentors often follow these posts to evaluate progress and quality of work.

## **Requirements for Joining the Program**

Since the program is fully remote, participants need:

- A **computer suitable for programming**  
- A **stable internet connection** with enough bandwidth for video calls  

Your educational or professional background does **not** matter. What matters is your **motivation** and **commitment** to building a new future for yourself in the software engineering industry.

A wide variety of people have joined the program, including:

- University students and graduates in software or computer science  
- High school students  
- Stay-at-home parents  
- Career changers  
- Participants from inside and outside Iran  

To succeed in this program, prior **programming experience** and the ability to **read English technical materials** are highly valuable. Lack of these skills does not block admission, but it significantly increases the workload required for completion.
