## Step 7. Security

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with a mentor based on your report.

- To apply authentication in Task 1, you can use the server we have prepared for you [here](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/web/servers/step7/server-step-7.rar).

   - Apply visibility of each button based on the current state of the app.
   - Use GitHub as your source control.

5. Pass these exercises at exercism.org:

   - ETL
   - Grade School

   Learn how to run tests for these steps, and run all available tests in spec file (remove x from the start of each xtest).

   - Use GitHub as your source control.
   - Publish it on your jsFiddle account.

6. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com with 5 stars up to **lesson 357**.

7. Achieve [**Teacher**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/1/teacher) badge on StackOverflow.

8. Find at least 5 other online resources about Authentication on the Web and explain why you chose them, then share them on Twitter and LinkedIn.

9. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.

10. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on the Twitch platform. You should record your live twitch and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation about its content. All Twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.
