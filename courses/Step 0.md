# Ice-Breaking Step

You are totally new to the club, Welcome to the club! There are lots of people in this club willing to help you. But how? How can you get help from them? Who is who!? Who knows what!?
This is your first task, you should talk (literally talk on the phone or Skype) and get to know each other.

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.

### Tasks

Throughout the course you need to be expressing yourself (emotions and knowledge) on social media. So go ahead and create some social media accounts if you don't already have. For each social media accounts you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags: #cs_internship #courseName #stepNumber.

- Create a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account.
- Create a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) account.

You should contact these people:

-  All the technical mentors
-  All interns in your club
-  Your own coordinator

Yon can find the information of technical mentors in **CS Internship - Coordination** telegram group.

Introduce yourself and ask them to introduce themselves. Within each conversation you should achieve these goals:

- Introduce yourself, so they will be able to introduce you to the others later in the club.
- Get to know them by asking about:
   1. Who they are,
   2. What their background is (technical and non-technical),
   3. What kinds of technical questions you can ask them.

Then, after knowing each person, you should take your time and share your knowledge and feelings about them:

- Post a **brief introduction** about them on Telegram (a summary of their answers to the 3 questions above) using #معرفی #cs_internship #courseName #stepNumber tags and mention name of the person you introduce using @NameOfThePersonYouIntroduce.
- Tweet your **feelings** about them using #معرفی #cs_internship #courseName #stepNumber and mention name of the person you introduce using @NameOfThePersonYouIntroduce.

And finally, you should ask (and convince) 5 of them to introduce you in the club by posting a paragraph about you.
