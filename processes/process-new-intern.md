# New Intern Process

## The Flow

#### 1. Getting-to-know Talk
Before the interview session, the new mentor should talk with their intern(s) as a way of communication and getting to know each other and also the mentor should set the time for an interview session with them.

#### 2. The Interview
The mentor and of course the new intern have to attend to this interview. In this session the new intern is told to prepare a commitment statement which should include the mentioned terms in this session.

#### 3. The Commitment Statement Verification
The intern has only 48 hours to give in their commitment statment to their mentor and when it's done the mentor should consider it and give feedbacks if need be. Note that if the amount of time committed by the intern is 20 hours per week, their mentor should mention that they need to spend 5 hours more when they start the second phase, i.e., dealing with real projects of companies. So if the intern agrees to this term as well, their commitment statement should be shared with other mentors to get verified.

#### 4. Starting The Internship
After verification, the new intern can now participate in this internship and start the course they had registered for.
