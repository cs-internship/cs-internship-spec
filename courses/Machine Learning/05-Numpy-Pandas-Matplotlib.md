## Step 5. Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with a mentor based on your report.
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 2 (Introduction to Numpy).
  2. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 3 (Data Manipulation with Pandas).
  3. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 4 (Visualization with Matplotlib).

### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Commentator**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/31/commentator) badge on StackOverflow.
 2. Achieve [**Nice Question**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/20/nice%20question) badge on StackOverflow.
 3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 223**.
 4. Do the exercise 3 in step 4 again but open the CSV file with **Pandas package** as a dataframe and add new four columns to it with name **MA1, MA2, MA3, and MA4** and for these columns calculate the [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of close price for durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 (N=5, 10, 15, and 30).
 5. Find at least 5 other online resources about numpy & pandas & matplotlib, and explain why you chose them.
 6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 7. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform. You should record your twitch at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.
 8. It's time to **be a mentor**. Ask your mentor to start your onboarding process for mentorship.


### Mentors Training
