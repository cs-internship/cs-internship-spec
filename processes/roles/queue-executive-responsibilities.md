# Queue Executive Responsibilities

This document aims to describe what the person in charge of queue during the sprint (which we call **queue executive**) is supposed to do.

## Glossary and general info

### glossary

**pre-queue**: is a queue in which applicants who have not yet talked to 5 people are in.  
**queue**: This is the queue, whose functionality is to show us the order in which applicants enter a course. Order of applicants in queue is based on the time they announced they are done talking with 5 people, **not** the time they entered the queue telegram group.  
**applicant**: a person who wants to enter a course, whether they are in *queue* or *pre-queue* or even none of them yet, is called an applicant.

### general info

- The applicants should be ordered based on the time they announce they have talked with 5 people and then the time they entered the queue telegram group.

- states an applicant can have and documents should present are:
  - in pre-queue
  - in queue
  - interviewed
  - cancelled
  - in course

- This document won't cover anything about how the OneNote documents should be structured. This document will only describe the functionalities that OneNote documents are supposed to have. As an example, the choice of merging pre-queue and queue in the same table or not, is not relevant to this doc.

## Responsibilities

### Being ready to be asked by a mentor to do a task

As the person in charge of queue, you should be ready to be asked by another mentor to do a task, such as adding a person to telegram group. Or remove someone, after they are interviewed.  

**Mentor and queue executive communications must comply with the following rules:**  
1- mentor should ask queue executive, by what time, the task is supposed to be done.  
2- queue executive, should tell mentor the time the task will be done by.  
3- Mentor is supposed to make sure the task gets done, by the time queue executive has promised.  
4- Any mentor who asks the queue executive to do a task, is supposed to **double check** that the task is done well.  

### Check if we are ready to conduct an interview

Queue executive must know exactly how many interns each mentor is willing to have, and how many interns the mentor already has.  
Whenever queue executive finds out that there is a mentor who has less interns than they are willing to have, and there exists some applicants who want to enter one of our courses, queue executive must:  
1- Announce that we are ready to conduct an interview.  
2- Find a mentor to be assigned the task of **organizing** the interview.  
(Note that by *organizing* an interview we mean, to make sure that the interviewer is selected and notified, participating mentors are notified about interview time and they are informed about what they should do during the interview, make sure that interns already have talked with 5 others about the course and they are somehow familiar with the course, etc.)

### Add an applicant to pre-queue

A random person may happen to get interested in cs internship and want to enter one of the courses. Queue executive will be asked to add such a person to pre-queue by either a mentor or the interns in the queue telegram group.  
**1- add to telegram group**  
Queue executive is responsible for adding that person to the telegram group (`CS Internship - Queue`). And greet the applicant by also introducing the cs-internship to them.  
**2- ask to talk with 5 people**  
Queue executive should ask that guy to talk with 5 people.  
Queue executive is responsible for informing that guy about what he is supposed to ask others about and what kind of information he/she is needed to gather.  
Queue executive should inform the applicant, that whenever they are done with talking with people and gathering information, they should announce in the telegram group that he/she has talked with 5 people and is willing to enter the queue.  
Queue executive should inform them that queue is based on the time they announce they've talked with 5 people, not the time they entered the course.  
**3- update OneNote**  
Queue executive is responsible for writing the information of the applicant and their state in OneNote.  
OneNote documents should contain the state of each applicant (Are they in queue or in pre-queue? Have they been interviewed? ...) How data of queue and pre-queue is written, is not covered here. Ask other mentors to know about the convention and format of writing these info.

### Add an applicant to queue

Whenever an applicant announces in the telegram group that they have talked with 5 people and are willing to enter a course:  
1- Queue executive should update the queue document in OneNote. So that document shows that the applicant is in queue not pre-queue.  
2- Queue executive should tell the applicant , their position in queue in telegram group and what course they are going to enter. Also, he/she should post an update in telegram group showing the order of applicants in the queue.

### remove from telegram group

After each interview meeting, one of the tasks to get done, is updating the telegram group and OneNote documents of queue.  After any interview, *interview organizer*, will ask queue executive to update those things and give him/her the needed information. Queue Executive:  
1- should update state of applicant in OneNote document. So that the document shows the applicant has been interviewed and possibly will enter one of the courses shortly.  
2- should post an update into telegram group and announce that the applicant has been interviewed, hence we are going to remove her/him from the group.  
3- should remove the applicant from telegram group.  
4- should post an update into telegram group and announce the updated order of applicants in the queue.  
5- Queue executive should tell the applicant at top of the queue, he/she is the next one to be interviewed.
