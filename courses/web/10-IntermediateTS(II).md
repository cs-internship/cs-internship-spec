## Step 10. IntermediateTS(II)

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.
