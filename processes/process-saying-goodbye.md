# Saying Goodbye Process

Goodbye (Farewell) is a bitter and painful word that we have all experienced many times in different ways.
Here is the process of saying goodbye to the course and the farewell message.


## The Flow

#### For people who are no longer allowed in the group you should:
1. Call and tell them to leave the group.
2. Send them a special goodbye message.

#### Three categories of people allowed to attend course groups:
1- Interns 
2- Active mentors 
3- Content providers


## Goodbye Message

Now the situation (for a specific reason) requires us to separate from our good friend and wish her/him success.

*in persion you say:*
.اکنون شرایط (به دلیل مشخص) اقتضا می‌کند که از دوست خوبمان جدا شویم و برای او آرزو موفقیت در هر کجا هست داریم

For example, Now, considering that he/she is not able to provide the required time for the course,
the situation requires us to separate from him/her. We wish her/him success wherever she/he is.

# Instructor Notes

Before this document, there was no other document and the process of saying goodbye in our team.
So, we decided to write a document to know when and how to say goodbye to our teammates.


# FAQ

- **Who can be in several (two or more) groups?**
Content providers and those who have completed a practical internship can be in several groups.
- **What about people who leave the lift group themselves?**
Only the predefined goodbye message should be sent to them.
